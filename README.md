# REDMIC

For several years our foundation has developed  a integrative repository for all kind of marine data (oceanographical, biological, dynamical, exploitations, transit, etc) . The application is still under development but in www.redmic.es you can gather an idea of its capacities, goals, and of what has been already achieved.

The authorities of my country have not shown particular interest in this challenging initiative which is at present at risk of being discontinued.  Therefore, the whole application has been ascribed to Creative Commons Initiative (CC) and we have removed any restrictive password from the code, so that any interested person can download it, use it, and hopefully continue with its development.  See the links shown below.  The code has been documented in English, but the general Memo of the project is in Spanish, I'm afraid. 

 

The beneficiaries of the OAG  Foundation are not only the Spanish central and regional marine administrations, but also the scientific organizations interested  in the sea, and, at large, the entire community of user and researchers of the sea.  REDMIC is our legacy to them.

 

If you need further information, please contact our system engineer Mr. Lorenzo. I am moving into retirement.

With best regards from the Canaries
